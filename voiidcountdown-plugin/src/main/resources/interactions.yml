# Entities of type INTERACTION with matching scoreboard tags will trigger commands when a player interacts with them.
#
# Notes:
# - Keys under rules are scoreboard tags applied to the INTERACTION entity (Entity#getScoreboardTags())
# - If your tag contains a colon or special characters, wrap the key in quotes.
# - Supported placeholders in commands: %player% (player name)
# - run_as: CONSOLE or PLAYER
# - cancel_event: whether to cancel the interaction event after handling
