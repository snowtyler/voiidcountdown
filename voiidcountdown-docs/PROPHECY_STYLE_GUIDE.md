THE PROPHECY, WHICH WHISPERS
AMONG THE SHADOWS.

THE LEGEND OF THIS WORLD.
<DELTARUNE.>

A WORLD BASKED IN PUREST LIGHT.
BENEATH IT, GREW ETERNAL NIGHT.

IF THE FOUNTAINS FREED, THE ROARING CRIES.
AND TITANS SHAPE FROM DARKENED EYES.

THE LIGHT AND DARK, BOTH BURNING DIRE.
A COUNTDOWN TO THE EARTH'S EXPIRE

THE POINTY-HEADED WILL SAY
"TOOTHPASTE," AND THEN "BOY."

BUT LO, ON HOPES AND DREAMS THEY SEND.
THREE HEROES AT THE WORLD'S END.

THE KNIGHT WHICH MAKES
WITH BLACKENED KNIFE.

SHALL DUEL WITH HEROES
STRIFE BY STRIFE.
