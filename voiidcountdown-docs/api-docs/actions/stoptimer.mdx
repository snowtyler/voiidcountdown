title: ".stopTimer()"
description: "Stop and destroy the active timer immediately."
---

## Usage Example

```java
//// VCTActions.stopTimer(sender?) ////

// Stop the active timer
boolean success = VCTActions.stopTimer(null);

// Stop the timer triggered by a player
boolean success = VCTActions.stopTimer(player);
```

## Behavior

- Completely ends the currently active timer.
- When stopped:
  - The timer is removed from memory.
  - The bossbar disappears immediately.
  - The `FINISH` event is not triggered (it is considered a manual interruption), but as a result, the `STOP` event is triggered.
- If no active timer exists, the method returns `false`.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="sender" type="CommandSender">
  Reference to the player who performed the action.

  - If a player passes, they will receive a message indicating that the timer was modified
    - It is usually not necessary to use it directly in the API
</ResponseField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the operation succeeded.

  - `true` — an active timer existed and was stopped.
  - `false` — no active timer existed or the operation failed.
</ResponseField>
