title: ".pauseTimer()"
description: "Pause the currently active timer."
---

## Usage Example

```java
//// VCTActions.pauseTimer(sender?) ////

// Pause the active timer
boolean success = VCTActions.pauseTimer();

// Pause the active timer triggered by a player
boolean success = VCTActions.pauseTimer(player);
```

## Behavior

- Temporarily freezes the countdown of the **currently active timer**.
- While paused:
  - The timer will **not decrease** in time.
  - The bossbar remains visible, showing the last paused value.
  - Events such as `FINISH` will not trigger until the timer is resumed.
- If no active timer exists, the method returns `false`.

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="sender" type="CommandSender">
  Reference to the player who performed the action.

  - If a player passes, they will receive a message indicating that the timer was modified
    - It is usually not necessary to use it directly in the API
</ResponseField>

## Returns

<ResponseField name="success" type="boolean">
  Indicates whether the operation succeeded.

  - `true` — the timer exists and is now paused.
  - `false` — no active timer exists or the operation failed.
</ResponseField>
